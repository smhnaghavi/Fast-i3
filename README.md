# Fast-i3
A theme and config to start using i3wm faster.

### Welcome to Fast-i3!

Fast-i3 is a i3wm script that helps you to make more beautiful i3wm and start using i3 faster.

The script supports openSUSE, Manjaro, Arch and Ubuntu for now, but we will add another linux distribution support in the future.

Now Let's start using script together!

# Installing 

Run the following command to clone the project files and run installation script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smhnaghavi/Fast-i3.git && cd Fast-i3 && ./install.sh
```
Now installation finished, and you can logout and login again into the i3.

If you get an error while running installation script, you can report it as an issue.
